C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O

The aim of the project is for the student to understand:

* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
